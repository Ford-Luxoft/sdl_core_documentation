| SDL        | SmartDeviceLink |
| ATF        | [Automated Test Framework](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_atf) |
| GitHub     | [Source code revision system](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_core/releases/tag/4.2.0) with released version of OpenSDL |


## Scope

### App Launch (iOS): 
 Integration of functionality already implemented in F-S SDL. Within the scope of the CRQ integration, SDL team removeд iAP2 transport implementation and Multiplexing functionality available in F-S SDL. 
 
### New implementation of requested functionality:
* Navigation interface: SDL behavior in case HMI does not respond to IsReady\_request or respond with "available" = false
* TTS interface: SDL behavior in case HMI does not respond to IsReady\_request or respond with "available" = false
* UI interface: SDL behavior in case HMI does not respond to IsReady\_request or respond with "available" = false
* VR interface: SDL behavior in case HMI does not respond to IsReady\_request or respond with "available" = false
* VehicleInfo interface: SDL behavior in case HMI does not respond to IsReady\_request or respond with "available" = false

# 2 About This Release

Implemented functionality for remote launching the applications from the supported Launch function devices.
Note: It is a business logic without supported device implementation. 
For further details, please refer [IAP](https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/), [AOA](http://source.android.com/devices/accessories/protocol.html), [SDL Core SAD](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/guides/core/software-architecture-document/components-view/#app-launch) or your transport API documentation.


Changed SDL behavior in case HMI does not respond to IsReady_request or respond with "available" = false for following interfaces: VR, UI, TTS, Navigation and VehicleInfo interfaces.

Short description of new behavior (*INTERFACE* is generic term used to described any of VR, UI, TTS, Navigation and VehicleInfo interfaces):

1. HMI respond *INTERFACE*.IsReady (false) -> SDL must return 'UNSUPPORTED_RESOURCE, success:false' to all single *INTERFACE*-related RPC
2. HMI respond *INTERFACE*.IsReady (false) and app sends RPC that must be splitted -> SDL must NOT transfer *INTERFACE* portion of splitted RPC to HMI
3. HMI does NOT respond to *INTERFACE*.IsReady_request -> SDL must transfer received RPC to HMI even to non-responded *INTERFACE* module
